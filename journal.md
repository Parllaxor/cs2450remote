Subject: Github repositories and engineering journal
Today we learned the basics of github and how to use it to create and push changes to a repository.
This is a skill I will need to learn and understand better in the future, however I feel I am starting to pick up on the basics.
Journaling will be a fun little thing to keep on top of, a good way to keep track of the things I've learned, the things I've created,
and generally be able to look back upon past successes or difficulties that I've learned from. I'll continue keeping track of the
most important events and experiences in this journal for the duration of my semester in CS2450, and likely even beyond that.

Subject: Idea generation and Youface beginnings

Today we brainstormed ideas in our group for our social media app that we will create in class. We have some good ideas, ideas that I've had for a long time. It will be exciting to see how we implement them. I've been able to learn more about WSL, I still have a lot to learn but I'm starting to catch on. My side project is going well as well, and I managed to create a github repository for my friend and I to work on it together, using information that I learned in class last week.

Subject: Application... application
Over the past few days, in order to prepare myself a little for the coming assignments in various classes, I have begun working on various coding projects, including some applications that I'd like to spend some time creating over the next few months, or even years. This will hopefully give me the experience I need to build applications in the future, and will be helpful for me in the future as I enter the career field.

Subject: Weighted dictionaries and repetition elimination
I've been working on some personal projects that have been helping me to better understand ways to write efficient code, for example I have learned a way to create embedded dictionaries for objects to give them "weighted values". This allows me to alter the probability of something being chosen from a list, or even eliminate repeats by setting weights to 0 after using them.
