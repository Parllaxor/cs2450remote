Subject: Github repositories and engineering journal
Today we learned the basics of github and how to use it to create and push changes to a repository.
This is a skill I will need to learn and understand better in the future, however I feel I am starting to pick up on the basics.
Journaling will be a fun little thing to keep on top of, a good way to keep track of the things I've learned, the things I've created,
and generally be able to look back upon past successes or difficulties that I've learned from. I'll continue keeping track of the
most important events and experiences in this journal for the duration of my semester in CS2450, and likely even beyond that.

Subject: Idea generation and Youface beginnings
Today we brainstormed ideas in our group for our social media app that we will create in class. We have some good ideas, ideas that I've had for a long time. It will be exciting to see how we implement them. I've been able to learn more about WSL, I still have a lot to learn but I'm starting to catch on. My side project is going well as well, and I managed to create a github repository for my friend and I to work on it together, using information that I learned in class last week.

Subject: Application... application
Over the past few days, in order to prepare myself a little for the coming assignments in various classes, I have begun working on various coding projects, including some applications that I'd like to spend some time creating over the next few months, or even years. This will hopefully give me the experience I need to build applications in the future, and will be helpful for me in the future as I enter the career field.

Subject: Weighted dictionaries and repetition elimination
I've been working on some personal projects that have been helping me to better understand ways to write efficient code, for example I have learned a way to create embedded dictionaries for objects to give them "weighted values". This allows me to alter the probability of something being chosen from a list, or even eliminate repeats by setting weights to 0 after using them.

Subject: Class structures and implementations
In 2420, we have been learning how to use ADT classes and it's been very eye opening for me. I've been able to learn a lot about how to use classes, the syntax for them, and I can definitely see the value in creating classes. I've previously learned how to use classes in C++, but have since become less than capable at using them. I would like to relearn some C++ coding in the next few months, while still trying to hone my abilities in Python, HTML and CSS.

Subject: Component diagrams and their value
In 2450, we needed to create a component diagram for our soon-to-be social media project. Our group threw something together, but didn't seem to fully comprehend what exactly the components were for, what they do, or why we even care. Yesterday and today, I've started doing some research on my own and have begun to understand now only the component diagram structure better, but also the value of the component diagram. This also goes with the flow diagram, something very valuable to ensure that code runs streamlined and not confusing. I still have tons to learn, but I'm definitely starting to make some progress.

Subject: Humble Beginnings
We have begun coding for our YouFace project over these last few days. I had a couple struggles trying to get the requirements.txt document to read by the code to download the various modules I would need, but in the end I got it working. I made the first pull request today, having added a "birthday" requirement to the login page of our project. I was content with what I figured out, managing to effectively navigate the many files and folders in the project, and it was definitely a good starting project to get off my feet and start understanding the code better.

Subject: Bags
We started learning about ADTs more in depth this class, learning about linked lists and various other styles of making bags that can insert, delete, retrieve, and do various other commands inside of a bag of objects. I've started brainstorming about things I could do with them.

Subject: Itertools
I started another side project to learn how to use the itertools module in python, there are a lot of useful tools in there and I would like to be able to learn how to use them and their possible implementations. I want to learn one new python module every two months, although it might be difficult and require more time to master because of the lack of practice time I possess at this time.

Subject: Halloween!
I have little to report this week. I have overhauled much of the Youface project in CS2450, and I have been enjoying learning how the code base works and have even gotten good enough that I rarely need AI's help to get things to work. Happy Halloween!

Subject: New project begin
Yesterday I started a new application-based project, using things I learned in CS2450. I'm building a Flask website using blueprints and various python code, including finding ways to implement BSTs and other algorithms I've learned in CS2420 and CS2100. I'm attempting to build it, at least for the most part, without the help of AI for any software related code, although I might use some for formatting and UX/UI.
